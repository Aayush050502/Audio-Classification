# ClassTone Classifier
A deep learning project which classify and categorize the audio recordings of my classmates.

## Introduction:
Audio classification is the process of categorizing audio signals into predefined labels or categories based on their acoustic features . It is an important task in audio signal processing , with numerous applications in various domains , including speech recognition , emotion recognition etc.
In the recent advances in deep learning , Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) have emerged as a powerful tool for audio classification . They can extract relevant features from audio signals in a data-driven manner and achive high accuracy in classification tasks.

## Aim:
To develop an accurate audio classification system that can classify and categorize the voices of my classmates.
